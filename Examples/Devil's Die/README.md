#Devil's Die

An example game built with OversimplifiedJS.

You place bets each roll, and the Devil matches your bet. Both bets go into the Pot. When the Pot reaches a certain Threshold (relative to the Bet and the Increment), then you take what's in the pot.

But the Devil takes the pot whenever:

* Your total roll is less than the Devil's roll,
* More than one of your dice lands on the same number as the Devil's Die, or
* The Devil rolls six.

NOTE: No real money is exchanged for use in this game. You begin with 1000 arbitrary "monies" that you can play with each time the game is refreshed.
